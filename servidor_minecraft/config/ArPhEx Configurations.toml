	#This controls whether all boss versions will require specific weather conditions to spawn. Without this, they will appear much more frequently. 
	"Bosses require weather?" = true
	#Do you want the boss and clone versions to spawn naturally, or only from summoning structures?
	"Boss natural spawning" = true
	#Bosses and variant spawns are rare by default. 1=twice as common. 2=default rarity. 3=twice as rare. 4=three times rarer. Avoid decimal and negative numbers.
	"Boss rarity" = 2.0
	#This controls whether the stalker bosses (spider moth, scorpioid bloodluster, draconic voidlasher, tormentor) are included in general. Set to false if you only want the other mobs, and the bosses will become unable to be spawned in any way.
	"Boss inclusion" = true
	#Controls the vanilla biome-specific spawnrates of ALL non-boss mobs in this mod, including minibosses and all regular arthropods. Default multiplier value is 5. You could more than double the ArPhEx spawnrates by setting it to 2 or 1. Lower values = more spawns (minimum value is 1). No maximum rarity. Avoid decimal and negative numbers.
	"Non-boss global spawnrates" = 5.0
	#ArPhEx has an additional spawning system that gives a 1 in (10) chance to spawn a random ArPhEx mob each time the natural spawn triggers. This system allows ArPhEx mobs to spawn in any non-vanilla overworld biomes, while still accounting for mob rarity. Default number is 10, meaning it has a 1 in 10 chance to spawn each time. Setting it to 0 disables the additional spawning system entirely. Avoid decimal and negative numbers.
	"Random-system spawn rates" = 10.0
	"All entities enabled/disabled" = true

	#Specifically disables the Tormentor boss entirely. It will be unable to be spawned in any form if this is enabled.
	"Disable Tormentor" = false
	#Disabled by default. If enabled, most mobs will become able to spawn in any dimension, including dimensions from other mods - may cause issues with some mod dimensions.
	"Spawn in other dimensions" = false
	#By default, the Tormentor can spawn naturally once you defeat the first three bosses. At this point, you probably won't be ready yet to fight it, and so will be forced to seal it and locate a crawling portal (all intentional). Set to false to prevent this, and ensure the Tormentor can only spawn from being summoned. The earlier - Boss natural spawning - config option has the same effect, but also controls other bosses.
	"Tormentor initial natural spawning" = true
	#Do you want to massively amplify all ArPhEx spawns futher on top of the existing spawns? Enabling this will drastically amplfy random-system overworld spawns from the mod, and even add crawling dimension mobs like the spider ambusher into the overworld. Even the non-overworld bosses will spawn rarely in the overworld, except for the Tormentor (this must be summoned manually). Minibosses will spawn commonly. Perfect for fast-paced, intense gameplay!

[Difficulty]
	#By default, the stalker bosses have hundreds of health points. Choose true to decrease their maximum to just 60 health. Avoid decimal and negative numbers.
	"Boss easy-mode" = false
	#Can increase damage for most ArPhEx mob, miniboss, and boss attacks. Affects their ranged projectiles too. Default value is 0. Positive values will give that level of strength to all arphex mobs. Avoid decimal and negative numbers, upper limit is 256. Does not affect Tormentor fight significantly.
	"Extra Difficulty Control" = 0.0
	#Can lower damage for most ArPhEx mob, miniboss, and boss attacks. Affects their ranged projectiles too. Default value is 0. Positive values will give that level of weakness to all arphex mobs. Avoid decimal and negative numbers, upper limit is 256. Does not affect Tormentor fight significantly.

	#Option to make the TORMENTOR weaker by lowering its max heath to any specific value. Default and maximum value is 1024.
	"Tormentor Max Health" = 1024.0
	#Value is in ticks. Since 20 ticks equate to a second, the default 25 ticks gives the Tormentor 1.25 seconds of immunity after each time it takes damage.
	"Tormentor Damage Speed Limit" = 20.0
	#With this mode enabled, all mobs from the mod become unable to target players for attack! For more peaceful gameplay, this is valuable. Full bosses such as the Tormentor and Voidlasher may not follow this setting entirely, so you may want to disable them if using this setting
	"Friendly Mode" = false
